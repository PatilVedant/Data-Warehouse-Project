#Data Warehouse Project - VBay Database

Introduction
I've conducted comprehensive data profiling, executed Extract, Transform, Load (ETL) processes specifically on the Snowflake platform, employed dbt for effective data modeling, and seamlessly integrated the processed data into Power BI dashboards for intuitive and insightful visualization. This repository contains the end-to-end workflow, highlighting the tools and methodologies employed at each stage to ensure a robust and efficient data pipeline.
