# DATA WAREHOUSE - VBAy Database

## Introduction
I've conducted comprehensive data profiling, executed Extract, Transform, Load (ETL) processes specifically on the Snowflake platform, employed dbt for effective data modeling, and seamlessly integrated the processed data into Power BI dashboards for intuitive and insightful visualization. My repository showcases the end-to-end workflow, highlighting the tools and methodologies employed at each stage to ensure a robust and efficient data pipeline.

## Tools and Methodolgy
In this project, I strategically harnessed the power of Snowflake, a cloud-based data warehouse, for its scalability and high-performance analytics. Complementing Snowflake, I employed dbt for efficient data transformation and modeling, ensuring modularity and version control. The Extract, Load, Transform (ELT) process, departing from traditional ETL methods, allowed me to directly extract raw data from sources, load it into Snowflake, and conduct transformations within the data warehouse. Following the Kimball data warehouse architecture methodology, raw data from the S3 bucket underwent cleaning and transformation using dbt, resulting in a refined analytics database. The integration of Power BI as my Business Intelligence tool provided a robust platform for creating user-friendly dashboards, enabling stakeholders to derive valuable insights and make informed decisions within the online marketplace context. This cohesive integration of Snowflake, dbt, ELT, and Power BI proved instrumental in the success of this data warehouse project, effectively transforming raw data into actionable intelligence.
